# Real-time-Vehicle-Detection-using-YOLOv8-OpenCV
This project allows users to upload a video file and detect vehicles (car, truck, bus, motorbike, bicycle) in real time with bounding boxes and labels. Optimized for CPU-only systems using frame resizing and frame-skipping for smooth playback. Includes a Tkinter file dialog for easy video selection and a clean exit option.
